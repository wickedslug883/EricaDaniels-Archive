# Artist-Page-App

## Artist Page
The teams' motivation was to create a webpage application that allows users to connect with their favorite artist. In this scenario, it is the artist Erica Daniels who is an up and coming Austin artist. As an musician’s avid fan, I want to learn about and connect with the artist. I also want to be able to buy tickets and merchandise so that I can support the artist directly instead of paying fees towards a third party where the artist only receives a percentage of the revenue.  This is because as more musicians enter the scene, it has been more difficult in keeping track of your favorite artist and support the artists directly. This application provides a platform for fans to connect and support their favorite artist.

* Use React for the front end.
* Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
* Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
* Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
* Have a polished UI.
* Be responsive.
* Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).
* Meet good-quality coding standards.
* Have a professional README.

## Usage
This is to allows users of the webpage to connect and support their favorite local artist. In this website it is Erica Daniels who is an up and coming Austin artist.
